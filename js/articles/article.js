Enter Narly Skates, a platform dedicated to skateboard magazine media. My landing page featured distinct sections: an About Us segment, introducing the brand and its mission; an Articles section, spotlighting captivating content tailored to the target audience; and finally, the Goals and Sign-Up sections, designed to engage users with aspirations and encourage subscriptions.",

This decision proved fruitful, pushing me beyond initial comfort and solidifying my foundational knowledge. Overall, this project was an enjoyable and valuable experience, honing my design a bilities both technically and creatively."

Understanding that a restaurant operates as a complex system with numerous interconnected processes, we embarked on the challenge of simulating this intricate environment. From seating guests to food preparation at various stations, each aspect was meticulously considered to offer a realistic and engaging experience to players. Throughout the development process, we encountered and successfully addressed numerous challenges, drawing upon the design patterns we had learned during the semester.",

To maintain efficiency, I intend to employ Tailwind CSS and SCSS for styling, as they are tools with which I am most proficient. Additionally, I've chosen PHP to further hone my skills in the language, especially considering its recent updates and extensive capabilities.
